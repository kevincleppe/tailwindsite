                <p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5">Our campus has a number of emergency "Blue Poles" that can be used to alert emergency services of any issues that are happening on campus. The idea is they are easy to spot, and have a big ol' red button on them that can be pressed to immediately reach out to campus police.</p>
                <img class="object-cover object-center rounded h-25" alt="emergency blue pole" src="https://tailwindsite.blob.core.windows.net/public/bp.jpg">
                <p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5">These are a great idea! The only issue is that these poles are a bit old, and after a decade or two of exposure to the elements, they are starting to show some signs of wear and tear. The rubber surroundings that are supposed to keep out the water and dust have eroded, and the equipment inside is unfortunately affected.</p>
                <p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5"> All the components are at risk, but the most at risk (and the priciest) item is the network switch, which I have been told is about $400 a piece. The white piece of equipment in the middle is the part in question. </p>
                <img class="flex justify-center items-center items-center justify-center object-center rounded w-" alt="internal components of a blue pole" src="https://tailwindsite.blob.core.windows.net/public/20240502_102648 (1).jpg">
<p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5"> So one of the network techs reached out to me and asked if we could make something that could go over the switch to protect it from the rain, and also be resilient enough to survive the summer heat. I have a couple of pictures of iterations of the first few designs, and the progress made between each, below:</p>
<img class="object-cover object-center rounded py-5" alt="internal components of a blue pole" src="https://tailwindsite.blob.core.windows.net/public/20240112_100508.jpg">
<p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5"> The cover you see above was our first real attempt at trying to figure out what a switch cover might look like. The requestor wanted to have something that could go over the switch ports, but also give enough clearance for the fiber optic cables to extend out without needing to be bent too much (fiber optics have glass in them, so you can have to be a bit more gentle with them than the traditional RJ-45 cable).</p>
<img class="object-cover object-center rounded py-5" alt="Second generation of blue pole switch covers" src="https://tailwindsite.blob.core.windows.net/public/IMG_0399 (1).jpg">
<p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5"> With the second iterations, we started to gve the inside of the container some more space for the cables, as well as a little bit more of a gap for the wires to stick out. Also, we learned (the fun way!) that PLA is no bueno for this sort of work, and switched to PETG. PLA is usually easier to work with, but it does not handle the summer heat well. I'll have a pic of what that looks like at the end of this write up.</p>

<p class=" flex justify-center text-left py-5"> One of the other things I started to learn about during this project was version control. We made a TON of different versions of this, each of which was ever so slightly different. How do you keep track of all these versions?</p>
