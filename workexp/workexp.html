          </h2>
          
          <div class="md:w-3/5 md:pl-6">
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-gray-900">In this role, I lead the Accessible Technology Services (ATS) team for CSUSB, which is comprised of three staff members, and 3-8 student assistants. We ensure WCAG 2.2 and Section 508 compliance for three areas: Web, Procurement, and Instructional Materials
            <br>
            <br>
            For web, we run automated reports for over 15,000+ web pages, and perform manual evaluations for high impact sites, and review vendor products for potential accessibility issues. We test with the WAVE, SilkTide, Axe, and ARIA Dev Tool browser extensions (as well a few others), and check for compliance with JAWS, NVDA, Narrator, Voice Over, ZoomText, and voice commands.
            <br><br>
            For procurement, we review Information Communication Technology (ICT) requests for accessibility issues through vendor provided Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs). If a product is considered high risk or has a high impact for the campus, we develop Equally Effective Alternate Access Plans (EEAAPs) to proactively provide accommodations for the barrier.

        <br><br>
            For Instructional Materials, we work with faculty members and campus members to proactively remediate documentation that may be used in a class, or used on campus. This includes PDFs, Power Points, Word docs, Forms, as well as captioning. We recently started training student assistants on document remediation, and to this day they have remediated over 14,000+ pages (they rock).

            <br><br>
            Finally, in my role, I over-see all of the pre-mentioned operations, debrief campus stake holders on improvements and needed changes, and train campus members on how to help out on accessibility related topics.

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-gray-900">
                For this, I wear two hats: one hat is the IT tech who helps campus users trouble shoot problems on their computers, and the other is an assistive technologist, where I show users how to get the most out of their devices, and how to navigate accessibility issues with either built in or third party solutions.

                <br><br>
                For the IT side, I run the Assistive Technology Center, a 35ish seat lab with hardware and software assistive technology solutions. This role has given me experience with a few different IT management solutions, such as Active Directory, SCCM, and Intune. It's also been a great opportunity to learn how to trouble shoot issues, and better understand how computers work.

                <br><br>
                This IT background was a perfect introduction to the Assistive Technology (AT) part, as I learned how to break down problems, and figure out the optimal way to solve them.

          <div class="md:w-3/5 md:pl-6">
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-gray-900">I was a grad assistant for a professor in my Cyber Security MS program. I taught in his absence (my favorite subject was digital forensics), took on research projects (the coolest one was learning about PowerShell Empire and presenting it in a class), and graded work for him. It was a fantastic experience, as the professor gave me challenging but fun projects, and was open to my own ideas (one idea I had was showing students the importance of proper document destruction, by having them put together a series of shredded documents to discover who the "spy" was in the class. Spoiler: it was me!). </p>
